# âœ… Product Landing Page Test Cases

1. **Header:**
	- Your product landing page should have a `header` element with an `id` of `header`.
	- You can see an image within the header element with an `id` of `header-img` (A logo would make a good image here).
	- Within the `#header` element, you can see a `nav` element with an `id` of `nav-bar`.
	- You can see at least three clickable elements inside the nav element, each with the class `nav-link`.
	- When you click a `.nav-link` button in the nav element, you are taken to the corresponding section of the landing page.
2. **Video:**
	- You can watch an embedded product video with `id="video"`.
3. **Form:**
	- Your landing page has a `form` element with an `id` of `form`.
	- Within the form, there is an input field with `id="email"` where you can enter an email address.
	- The `#email` input field should have placeholder text to let users know what the field is for.
	- The `#email` input field uses HTML5 validation to confirm that the entered text is an email address.
	- Within the form, there is a submit input with an `id="submit"`.
	- When you click the `#submit` element, the email is submitted to a static page (use this mock URL: https://www.freecodecamp.com/email-submit).
4. **Navigation & Layout:**
	- The navbar should always be at the top of the viewport.
	- Your product landing page should have at least one media query.
