## 📋 User Stories

### Structure
- **Main Container:** A `main` element with `id="main"` containing all other elements
- **Title:** An element with `id="title"` describing the tribute subject (e.g., "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
- **Image Section:** A `figure` or `div` with `id="img-div"`
  - Inside, an `img` with `id="image"`
  - Inside, an element with `id="img-caption"` describing the image
- **Info Section:** An element with `id="tribute-info"` describing the tribute subject
- **External Link:** An `a` element with `id="tribute-link"` linking to more info (use `target="_blank"`)

### Responsive Design
- The `#image` should use `max-width` and `height` properties to resize responsively, relative to its parent, without exceeding its original size
- The `img` should be centered within its parent
